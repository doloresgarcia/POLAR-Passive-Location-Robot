# POLAR Passive Location Robot

Passive object localization with IEEE802.11ad using phased antenna arrays
 
- Use Matlab 2018 or 2019
- Run MAIN_run.m to obtain the results of an example of the algorithm for real data where the robot is displaced over a horizontal line.

Checking the amplification different Beam patterns introduce, we can determine the AoA of the paths in the channel.
By observing the paths that are movile over a couple of frames, new moving reflections are detected, the reflections of a moving object in the room!
